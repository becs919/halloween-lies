      <h2 class="titles">Welcome to Hollywood!</h2>
      <p>It is award night and Tom Speed’s latest film, "The Vampire Detective", has just
        swept the board and won four “Skellies” for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best
        Director and Best Screenplay. Sadly, Tom Speed’s award for Best Actor
        was accepted posthumously by his friend, Hayden Vicars, as Tom was
        killed in a driving accident late last night…</p>
      <p>Despite this note of sadness, celebrations are in full swing at The Vampire
        Detective’s post-award party. Deals are being cut for future productions and
        everyone is having a good time enjoying the atmosphere and mingling with
        Hollywood’s movers and shakers.</p>
      <p>Is there anything suspicious about Tom Speed’s death? Who will win next
        year’s Skellies? Find out at Halloween Lies.</p>
